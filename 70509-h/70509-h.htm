  <h2 class='c012'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A “caricature history” does not mean that history is caricatured. On the contrary, a good
caricature enables us to see, in a true light, facts that might otherwise be hidden or misrepresented.
We understand current events and the social life of England from the illustrations of <i>Punch</i> more
truly than from the columns of the <i>Times</i> or the <i>Morning Post</i>. Canada is only beginning life, and
our politics touch subjects of general interest so seldom, that it is sometimes thought and said that there
is no field for a Canadian <i>Punch</i>; but the fact, perhaps not generally known, that for the last forty
years, at any rate, we have rarely been without artists whose pictures on the questions of the day have
appealed successfully to popular humor, proves that our political life has been robust from the beginning. Some
of these artists had to content themselves with publishing fly-sheets that provoked the laughter of the town, but
that had no chance of obtaining more than a local reputation. For others, organs well-known in their day, such
as <i>Punch in Canada</i>, <i>Diogenes</i>, and <i>Grinchuckle</i>, were established at different times prior to 1873, when <span class='sc'>Grip</span>
vaulted into the seat which he has occupied since to the satisfaction of all Canada. Requests have been
frequently made for a work containing a continuous series of his cartoons, and in now acceding to these it has
been thought well to give illustrations of what was done among us in the same line previously. Fortunately the
publishers were able to obtain selections from the sources to which I have referred, and also from the <i>Canadian
Illustrated News</i>; and the First Volume of this work thus gives something like a continuous pictorial history of the
events that have stirred popular feeling most deeply since 1848. They believe that those older representations
will be heartily welcomed, and they desire to thank all who have assisted in making the work so extended.</p>

<p class='c010'>As to <span class='sc'>Grip</span> himself, he needs no letters of commendation, but, with his well-known regard to the established
usages of society, he thinks that there should be a Preface to the work. Considering how freely he takes a
hand in our concerns, and that, in order to show us what goes on behind the scenes, he has no hesitation in
entering bar-rooms, Government Houses, Palaces, and the Privy-Council Chambers of our pastors and masters,
this modesty on his part will be duly appreciated by a modesty-loving public.</p>

<p class='c010'>A young member of our House of Commons waxed eloquent in the course of his maiden speech, and,
naturally enough, some of his brethren thought him mad. Not so thought Joseph Howe, to whom Shakespeare
was dearer than all the Blue-books in the Parliamentary Library: “Thank God for a bit of poetry in this dry-as-dust
House,” whispered the old man to a near neighbor. Yes, and thank God for Humor, with its intuitive
perception of truth, and its consequent impartiality. Without <span class='sc'>Grip</span>, what Saharas our Parliaments would be!</p>

<p class='c010'>Every man should take an intelligent interest in the political life of his country. But from what quarter is
he to get information? He cannot get Hansard; and even if he could, life is too short to read the terrible
volumes. To trust himself to this or that party paper will insure interest but not intelligence; and to read the
papers on both sides will land him in hopeless scepticism, or drown him “in a popular torrent of lies upon lies.”
On the whole, he cannot do better than trust <span class='sc'>Grip</span>, as the most honest interpreter of current events we happen
to have. <span class='sc'>Grip</span>, too, not only generally hits the nail on the head, but sometimes hits like a blacksmith—and we
belong to a race that loves to see a blow well struck. Besides, the fellow has no malice in him. He has always
a merry heart, and that doeth good like a medicine. Many a laugh he has given us, and laughter clears away
unwholesome fogs from the spirit. Along with music it is next best to Holy Writ, according to the testimony
of Martin Luther. A picture, too, has this unspeakable advantage over verbiage, that you can take in the
situation at a glance, and if it is not agreeable, you can pass on. You condemn the representation as unfair, but,
at any rate, your time is not lost.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>I do not speak as an artist of the cartoons or the caricatures that illustrate our political history since
1873. To me their artistic merit is exceptionally great, but I am not qualified to speak as a critic of technique.
I speak only as a public teacher who knows that the educational influence of pen or pencil may be greater than
that of the living voice, and who rejoices when that influence is on the right side.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this case it is on the right side. <span class='sc'>Grip</span> is impartial, in a country where it is very hard to be impartial, and
harder still to have your impartiality acknowledged. <span class='sc'>Grip</span> is also always patriotic. He is something even better—he
is healthy. You may think him at times Utopian. You may not agree with the means he proposes, but
you must always sympathize with the end he has in view. He is scrupulously clean. He never sneers. In the
best sense of the word, he is religious.</p>

<p class='c010'>One word more: <span class='sc'>Grip’s</span> humor is his own. It has a flavor of the soil. It is neither English nor American.
It is Canadian.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honor formally to introduce to you my esteemed friend, Mr. <span class='sc'>Grip</span>. You
may receive him with confidence into your homes and hearts.</p>

</div>
<hr class='c021' />
<p class='c013'>From the date of the English conquest of Quebec and the Treaty of Paris
(1763) down to the year at which the present brief historical sketch opens,
(1841), the history of Canada is a story of unrest and agitation. The old-world
simplicity and pious contentment of the French <i>habitant</i> was intruded
upon by the advent of the more enterprising Briton, and ere long the inevitable struggle
began. The French Canadian, whose language, laws and religion had been specially
reserved to him by the Treaty, was not unnaturally apprehensive of the consequences of
English domination, and with a new-born energy he awoke to the defence of his rights.
His English fellow-colonist having discovered that the governmental arrangements were
too primitive and narrow for the comfort of one who had formerly lived under the
British constitution, lost no time in commencing the agitation for reform. In some
of his views—outside of the sacred reservation referred to—his French neighbor joined
him. Hand in hand they protested against the infringement of their common rights by
the Governor and his Council, and demanded changes in the constitution. Meantime the
English element was growing in the country west of Montreal, by emigration from the
old land, and accessions of Loyalists from the newly-established Republic of the United
States. The superiority of the British settler soon made itself manifest in the material
conquests which he achieved over the forests. The new English Province rapidly surpassed
the old French one in prosperity, and the flames of jealousy were rekindled. Ultimate ruin
of the colony from internecine strife seemed inevitable unless some adequate remedy could
be found. The separation of the rival races naturally suggested itself as that remedy, and as
they were already practically divided geographically—the number of English settlers in the
French Province being comparatively small—great hopes were built upon a similar division
politically. The Imperial Government accordingly in 1791 passed the Constitutional Act, by
which the country was divided into the two Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, each
being granted a representative form of government and a constitution supposed to be
suited to its population. The governmental machinery provided for each Province under
this Act was a Governor, appointed by the Crown, and responsible to the Imperial
authorities alone; a Legislative Council, appointed for life by the Governor, and a
Legislative Assembly, elected by the people on a suffrage almost universal. The executive
functions of the supposedly popular branch of this governmental system were nominally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>vested in a committee known as the Executive Council, the members of which were
selected by the Governor, usually from the judiciary, the membership of the Legislative
Council, and the ranks of salaried officials. Practically the Governor himself was the real
executive, as his Council thus chosen (and responsible only to himself as representative
of the Crown) was regarded by him merely as an advisory committee in grave matters of
policy, but as possessing no control over appointments to office, and the various other
matters, which under our present system appertain to the executive. This proved a fatal
weakness. In both Provinces the Executive Councils gradually drifted away from the
sympathy of the people as represented in the Assemblies. The breach became wider and
wider, until at length the discontent of the people terminated in open rebellion (1838).</p>

<p class='c010'>At this juncture the Imperial Government appointed Lord Durham to proceed to
Canada and report upon the state and requirements of the country, civil and military. After
five months spent in investigation, Lord Durham prepared his celebrated Report, which was
duly submitted to the government of Lord John Russell (1839). In this document a
legislative union of the Provinces was recommended, and the Home Government proceeded
without delay to carry the recommendation into effect. It was thought desirable, however,
to secure the assent of the people of the Provinces before passing the Union measure, and
for this purpose Mr. Charles Poulett Thompson (afterwards Lord Sydenham), was
despatched to Canada. On his arrival (17th October, 1839) he found Lower Canada
without an Assembly—that body having been superseded by a Select Council appointed by
Lord Durham’s successor in the governorship—Sir John Colborne. This Council being
chiefly composed of adherents of the British party readily gave the required assent, and
subsequently the Upper Canada Assembly and Legislative Council acquiesced. A draft
Union Act was forthwith prepared and forwarded to England, and a measure founded
upon it was at once passed.</p>

<p class='c010'>By this Act, the country was renamed the Province of Canada, and the governmental
machinery provided was, a Governor, representing the Crown, a Legislative Council of
24, to be appointed for life, and an assembly of 84 members, to be elected by the people,
and executing its business through a Responsible Government. This Act went into
effect in the year 1841, when the first United Parliament met at Kingston, which had been
chosen as the Capital by the Governor. The first session passed off in a manner
which on the whole promised well for the new system, although it was made manifest
that the people of Quebec regarded the Union as a scheme to which they had not
assented—the Special Council, which had acted for them in the matter, having been
in no sense a truly representative body. The session was chiefly remarkable, however,
for a distinct pledge given by the Ministry—though with apparent reluctance—that the
Government would fully acknowledge its responsibility to the people as that term was
understood under the British constitution. This was regarded as a signal victory by the
advocates of the responsible system, as the first Cabinet was composed of mixed elements—some
of its leading members having been known as pronounced opponents of “Responsibility.”
The fact that there was no French representative in the Ministry augmented the
discontent of Lower Canada, but the election of one of their trusted compatriots to the
speakership did something to mollify this feeling.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Governor-General, who, for his services in connection with the Union, had been
raised to the Peerage, under the title of Lord Sydenham, was in delicate health at the
time of the first session of the House, and died before the second session began, his end
being hastened by an accident which befel him while taking his customary horseback
exercise. It was some months before the Home Government appointed a successor to the
vice-royalty, and during the interregnum the affairs of the Province were administered by
Lieut.-General Sir Richard Jackson, commander of the forces in Canada. Meantime, Sir
Robert Peel had succeeded to power in England, and, as a natural consequence, the new
Governor-General was selected from the Conservative ranks. The choice fell upon Rt.
Hon. Sir Charles Bagot, who was known in Imperial politics as a “High Tory,” and
was a man of acknowledged ability and wide diplomatic experience. The friends of
Responsible Government in Canada were apprehensive of bad consequences to the newly
inaugurated system as a result of this appointment, but their fears were in due time
dispelled, as Sir Charles proved a thoroughly constitutional Governor. Indeed, so
conscientiously did he keep within the exact limits of his powers throughout his term of
office, that his only enemies were amongst the reactionary section of the Canadian Tory
party. The new Governor, when he met Parliament in 1842, found the Sydenham
Government still in office, though manifestly weak in the House, and almost certain of
defeat on the first opportunity offered. A Kingston paper of the day described this
Cabinet as follows: “Instead of being a coalition of moderate men it is a coalition of
fierce extremes. How they can meet at the Council Board and not laugh in each other’s
faces if in merry mood, or come to fisticuffs if in angry one, must be an eighth wonder of
the world.” In Parliament they were earnestly opposed on the one hand by the old-line
Conservatives, under the leadership of Sir Allan Macnab and Mr. John S. Cartwright,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>member for Lennox and Addington, and on the other hand by the Upper Canada
Reformers and Radicals, under Hon. Robt. Baldwin, in alliance with the French Canadian
members, who acknowledged Louis Hypolite Lafontaine as their leader. This distinguished
gentleman now entered the Union Parliament for the first time, sitting for the
fourth riding of York, for which constituency he had been elected on the personal introduction
of Mr. Baldwin. A motion of no confidence was moved early in the session, but,
instead of allowing the vote to be taken, the Cabinet resolved upon a reconstruction, and
after considerable difficulty this was effected by the retirement of three of the Conservative
members, and the accession in their stead of Mr. Baldwin, Mr. Lafontaine and Mr. Morin,
the two latter being the first French representatives admitted to seats in the Cabinet.
With the second session ended the career of the second Governor-General. Sir Charles
Bagot was through illness obliged to relinquish the post. His successor was Sir Charles
T. Metcalf, late of India and Jamaica, who assumed office in Canada, March 30th, 1843.
Sir Charles Bagot died on the 19th of May following, at Kingston. The new Governor-General
entered upon his duties with a high reputation for ability, rectitude and independence
of mind, and a record which marked him as a Liberal statesman. His eastern
experiences and training, however, were against the probability of his success in his new
sphere, for a colonial application of Responsible Government was one of those things he
did not understand. The Cabinet that saluted him on his arrival is known in our history
as the Lafontaine-Baldwin Ministry, and on the assembling of the third session, it was
found that this reconstructed Government commanded a large majority in the House. The
weakness of the Opposition, composed as it was, in Sir Chas. Metcalf’s opinion, of representatives
of “the only party in the country upon whom the mother country might
confidently rely in the hour of need,” evoked the sympathy of the new Governor, and it
was not long before the cordiality between him and some of the members of the administration
began to wane. It became apparent that the Governor was not disposed to
interpret “Responsible Government” to mean that the Governor-General was a mere
figure-head. He claimed the right to exercise a certain amount of patronage on his own
account, and asserted that his responsibility in various matters was to the Imperial authorities
directly and not to the people of Canada through his ministers. Sir Charles’ ardent
wish was to obliterate the strong party lines and allay the rancorous hostilities around
him, and it is evident that he thought to effect these good ends by appointing Conservatives
to various offices as opportunity might offer. In the meantime, while outwardly at peace
with his ministers, the Governor openly cultivated very friendly relations with prominent
members of the Opposition party.</p>

<p class='c010'>The session of 1843 began on the 28th of September, and was signalized by a long
and hot debate on the subject of the removal of the seat of Government, the ministry
having decided to establish the capital at Montreal. The vote finally taken showed a good
majority in favor of the removal, though as one consequence of it, Mr. Jameson, Speaker
of the Legislative Council, resigned his seat. This resignation assumed some importance
as a factor in the developments of the near future, when it came to the knowledge of the
ministry that the vacant chair had been offered by the Governor-General—acting, of
course, without their advice—to a prominent Conservative, Mr. L. P. Sherwood, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>subsequently to another opponent of the Government, Mr. Neilson, of Quebec. Prior to
this discovery, however, His Excellency appointed one Mr. Francis Powell (also a Conservative)
to the position of Clerk of the Peace for Dalhousie District—of which action he
subsequently informed his ministers in a note. This little missive was the signal for a
long and stubborn contest, in which the very principles of Responsible Government were
considered by the Reform Party to be at stake.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Cabinet at once deputed Messrs. Lafontaine and Baldwin to wait upon the
Governor-General, and to represent to him that in their view the exercise of the prerogatives
of the Crown without reference to the responsible ministry was contrary to the letter
and spirit of the resolutions of 1841, in which Responsible Government in its fullest sense
had been affirmed as the new Canadian constitution. That the Governor possessed
certain prerogatives of appointment to office, etc., they did not deny, but they insisted that
before exercising any of these the system required him to consult his advisers, who, if they
could not approve, had the alternative of resigning. Sir Charles Metcalfe could not be
brought to take this view of his duty; on the contrary, he regarded it as derogatory to the
dignity of the Crown to accept such a condition, which, he contended, was not contained
in the Resolutions of 1841, as he interpreted them. In this position, which he maintained
throughout the contest, the Governor appears to have been upheld by Lord Stanley, the
Colonial Secretary in the Home Government. The conference having been without
result—except to make the attitude of the Governor perfectly clear—all the members of
the Government, excepting Mr. Dominic Daly, Provincial Secretary for Lower Canada,
resigned their portfolios. A prolonged debate ensued in the House, which was brought
to a close by the passage of the following resolution by a vote of 64 to 23: Moved by
Mr. Price, seconded by Mr. Benjamin Holmes, “That an humble address be presented to
His Excellency, humbly representing to His Excellency the deep regret felt by this House
at the retirement of certain members of the Provincial Administration on the question of
the right to be consulted on what the House unhesitatingly avow to be the prerogative of
the Crown, appointments to office; and further to assure His Excellency that the advocacy
of this principle entitles them to the confidence of this House, being in strict accordance
with the principles embraced in the resolution adopted by this House on the 3rd of
September, 1841.” Parliament rose on December 9th, and the country was thus left
without any regular Ministry, in which condition it practically remained for some nine
months. In the meantime, Mr. D. B. Viger, a prominent French Canadian, and Mr.
Draper (afterwards Chief Justice) had been prevailed upon to join Mr. Daly—and for the
greater portion of the period mentioned this semblance of a Cabinet were the only
advisers of the Governor. These months, as may easily be supposed, were filled up with
vociferous debate on the platform and through the press. The Conservative Party very
generally sided with the Governor, and he was not without many able defenders of the
course he had taken; on the other hand he was violently denounced and even defamed by
the Liberals, who looked upon him and his sympathisers as the deliberate enemies of
popular rights. It was during this “interregnum,” <i>i.e.</i>, on the 5th of March, 1844, that
the Toronto <i>Globe</i> made its first appearance as an organ of the Liberal Party under the
editorship of Mr. Peter Brown and his subsequently famous son, George, and it was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>struggle then going on which paved the way for the public career of the younger man.
Mr. Viger exerted his utmost influence to win the Lower Canadians to the Governor’s
side, but in this he signally failed, and when at length after vast trouble the vacant Cabinet
places had been filled up, it was so evident that they could command no following in the
House that a dissolution and general election were decided upon. The result of this
contest—which was bitter beyond precedent—was a small majority for the Government in
the Parliament of 1844. Amongst the newly-elected members was Mr. (now Sir) John
A. Macdonald, who was returned as Member for Kingston. Mr. Draper resigned his seat
in the Legislative Council to assume the leadership of the Government, and it required all
his acknowledged ability to weather the storm of the Session, for meantime the Lafontaine-Baldwin
Party was steadily gaining strength. While matters were in this precarious
condition, the Governor-General was obliged on
account of ill health to resign his office, and
return to England. Ere leaving Canada he was
raised to the Peerage with the title Baron
Metcalfe of Fern Hill, but he had worn his new
honors but a few months before death relieved
him of his sufferings (5th September, 1846).
Whatever may be thought of Lord Metcalfe’s
political views or actions, all who are authorized
to speak of him personally agree in describing
him as a most generous, kindly and lovable
man. Earl Cathcart, Commander-in-Chief of
the Forces in Canada, succeeded to the Governor-Generalship
after a brief period as Administrator,
and under his rule the struggle between
the parties continued.</p>

<p><span class='c001'>“FRENCH DOMINATION.”</span><br /><br />(<i>From Punch in Canada.</i>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>But that time was fortunately very brief. In justice to Lord Cathcart it must be said
that he took no active part in the Government, his attention being wholly occupied by
military matters in view of the strained relations of England and the United States over
the Oregon Boundary matter. It was chiefly as a military expert that he had been placed
at the head of affairs, and the probability of war having disappeared by the ratification of
the Oregon Treaty, the Imperial Government relieved him of the Viceroyalty, and selected
Lord Elgin, a trained statesman, as his successor. This nobleman bore an exceptionally
high character and his official career had hitherto been very successful. Like Lord
Metcalfe he left the Governorship of Jamaica to assume that of Canada. In politics he
was a Conservative, but could not fairly be described as a Tory in the fullest meaning of
that term. The new Governor-General was sworn into office on January 30th, 1847, and
one of his first utterances in reply to the usual addresses of welcome was, “I am sensible
that I shall best maintain the prerogative of the Crown, and most effectually carry out
the instructions with which Her Majesty has honored me, by manifesting a due regard for
the wishes and feelings of the people and by seeking the advice and assistance of those
who enjoy their confidence.” Lord Elgin met his first Parliament on June 2nd. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Government had meanwhile been reconstructed, Mr. Draper having retired from the leadership
in favor of Mr. Henry Sherwood, and amongst other new members was Mr. John A.
Macdonald, who had accepted the post of Receiver-General. At the close of this session
Mr. Draper was honored with a judgeship, and rising from one judicial dignity to another,
he at length achieved the highest place on the Canadian Bench—the Presidency of the
Court of Error and Appeal. He died in 1877. The Sherwood-Daly Government was
overwhelmingly defeated at the general election held early in 1848, and the Baldwin-Lafontaine
Ministry returned to power. Amongst the members of the new House were William
Hume Blake (father of Hon. Edward Blake) and Louis Joseph Papineau, who, from 1809
until his banishment for complicity in the rebellion of 1838, had been an influential leader
of the Lower Canadians. He had been permitted to return to Canada in 1843, but his
distrust of British rule and his wild project of a Canadian Republic were in no respect
abated. In the House of Assembly he soon arrayed himself in deadly opposition to the
Cabinet, denouncing “Responsible Government” in unmeasured terms. The adoption
of the Free Trade policy in England at this time had a depressing effect upon Canadian
commerce, as Canada ceased to be as heretofore the highway of American exports to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>English markets. The result of this was the growth of a sentiment in favor of annexation.
Parliament next met on the 18th of January, 1849, when Mr. George Etienne Cartier and
Alexander Galt made their first appearance as members. Early in the session an Amnesty
Bill in favor of those expelled from the country through the rebellion of ’37-8 was passed.
Under this measure Mr. Wm. Lyon Mackenzie returned to Canada from his exile in the
United States. Besides this Bill, some two hundred more or less important measures
were passed, amongst them being the Act reorganizing the Court of Chancery. While
this Bill was regarded as an inestimable boon by all concerned, it was the means of closing
the promising political career of Mr. Hume Blake, who, in deference to the wishes of his
colleagues and of the legal profession of the Province, accepted the Chancellorship. The
great measure of the session, from the historical point of view, was the Rebellion Losses
Bill. This measure was intended to supplement the compensation already granted by the
Provincial Assemblies of Upper and Lower Canada to loyal citizens who had suffered loss
by the rebellion of 1837-8. The legislation referred to had not recognized the cases of
many whose property had been destroyed or damaged, not by rebels, but by those acting
ostensibly in support of the authorities. This further relief was granted by an Act passed
in the first session of the Union Parliament, but was restricted to Upper Canada. The Bill
now passed extended the provisions for compensation to Lower Canada as well. Commissioners
had been appointed by the Draper Government in 1845 to investigate and report
upon the amount of money which would be required to settle the claims indicated, but great
difficulty had been encountered in distinguishing between claimants who were entitled to
relief and those who had been implicated more or less seriously in the rebellion. The
report of the Commissioners was therefore not such as to afford a safe basis for legislation,
and the Government, owing nothing to the Lower Canadians on the score of political
support, had taken no further action. The Lafontaine-Baldwin Government felt that they
were in duty bound to carry out the measure of justice which the former Government had
initiated, and the French influence had now become strong enough to compel this even if
the Government had felt otherwise. The Bill as passed expressly excluded from participation
in the indemnity all rebels under the description of those “who had been convicted
of treason or had been transported to Bermuda.” It was reasonably believed that after the
lapse of so many years, it would be impracticable to make any distinctions between “loyal
citizens” and “rebels” apart from the record of the courts of law. The Opposition
insisted, however, that such distinction <i>must</i> be made: and that no person who had taken
part in the rebellion, whether convicted or not, should on any account be paid for his
losses. The whole Conservative party took this “high loyal” ground, and the Bill at
once evoked the most furious enmity in that quarter. The measure was debated in the
House with unexampled passion—its chief opponents there being Mr. Sherwood, Col.
Gugy, Sir Allan MacNab and Col. Prince; and its ablest defender Mr. Wm. Hume Blake,
whose speech is justly regarded as the greatest effort of his life and the most powerful
address ever delivered in the Canadian Parliament. The Bill was finally carried on March
9th by a majority of forty-seven to eighteen. Meantime the Tory party throughout the
Province had poured in petitions to the Governor-General, demanding the reservation of the
Bill or a dissolution of the House. After careful consideration, Lord Elgin could not see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>that his duty lay in either of these directions, and he accordingly assented to the measure
amongst others on Wednesday, April 25th. As he retired from the Council Chamber
after this ceremony, he was greeted with groans and hisses by a mob assembled in front of
the building, and as his carriage rolled away it was pelted with rotten eggs. This incident
is referred to in the first cartoon from <i>Punch in Canada</i> imbedded in our letter-press. In
the evening of the same day a crowd assembled on the Champ-de-Mars, where “loyal
speeches,” openly advocating violence, were made. The mob was in a fitting frame of
mind, and was swift to act upon the ill-advice. Amidst shouts and curses, an advance was
made upon the Houses of Parliament. The legislators, engaged in discussing an important
measure at the moment, were startled by the crashing in of the windows, and soon the
rioters entered the chamber where, with maniacal fury, they demolished everything that was
breakable, and wound up the peculiar display of “fealty to the Crown” by setting fire to
the buildings. The Assembly House was totally consumed, involving a direct money loss
far exceeding the amount appropriated by the Bill which had afforded the pretext for the
outrage. Parliament assembled the next day in a chamber improvised in the Bonsecours
market building. Sir Allan MacNab and a few of his political colleagues spoke in justification
of the riot, and declared that the blame rested more with the Government than with
the mob (see <a href='#i033'>Cartoon 1</a>). The members of the Ministry and many of their leading
supporters were for several days maltreated on the streets, and the residences of Mr.
Lafontaine and others in Montreal were wrecked by the mob. The carnival of “Loyalty”
was kept up until the 30th when it culminated in a second and still more disgraceful attack
upon Lord Elgin, on the occasion of an official visit to the Government House on Notre
Dame street. After this outrage Lord Elgin remained in seclusion at Monklands for many
months, earning thereby the sobriquet of the Hermit (see <a href='#i039'>Cartoon 4</a>). Parliament was
prorogued on May 30th, Major General Rowan, Commander of the Forces, being commissioned
to act for the Governor-General, who thought it best to avoid another demonstration
of the “loyalists.” The Government re-appointed the Draper Commissioners to carry
out the provisions of the Rebellion Losses Bill in the adjudication of claims, and instructions
were given them to use all possible care to distinguish between “rebels” and “loyalists”
amongst the claimants, but this conciliatory action passed for little with the Tory press.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c010'>During the vacation, Sir Allan MacNab and Hon. Wm. Cayley proceeded to England
to place the Tory view of the Rebellion Losses Bill before the public there; and about the
same time Mr. Francis Hincks crossed the ocean on a similar errand for the Liberal party.
Lord Elgin’s course in the matter was ultimately sustained in both Houses of the Imperial
Parliament when the subject came up for consideration. Subsequent riotous demonstrations
in Montreal decided the question of the removal of the seat of Government from that city.
The remaining two sessions were accordingly held in Toronto, and thereafter it was arranged
to transfer the honor alternately to Quebec and Toronto every four years. The removal
to Toronto took place in November, 1849, and the official residence was fixed at Elmsley
Villa, on the site of the present Central Presbyterian Church.</p>

<p class='c010'>As an outcome of the prevailing commercial depression of the time the project of
annexation to the United States had come prominently forward for discussion, and in
October a manifesto in favor of a peaceful separation from the Mother Country and a union
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>with the Republic was published at Montreal. Amongst the signers of this celebrated
document were many prominent persons connected with both political parties, amongst
the number being Mr. Benjamin Holmes, to whom reference is made in this connection
in the <i>Punch in Canada</i> cartoons. Mr. Papineau earnestly advocated the scheme, in
consistence with his long cherished republican opinions, and many other public men—amongst
them Col. Gugy—were suspected of sympathy with the movement. The only
practical result of the agitation was to deprive some of those implicated in it of offices
which they held at the pleasure of the Crown.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The next great questions to press for settlement were those relating to the Secularization
of the Clergy Reserves and the abolition of Seigniorial Tenure—questions which concerned
the Upper and Lower Provinces respectively. The first of these had its rise in the blunder
originally made by the Imperial authorities in setting apart a large portion of the public
domain for the maintenance of “a Protestant clergy.” As population increased and settlement
spread, the lands thus apportioned in various parts of the country—particularly those
in Upper Canada—became valuable, and a hot dispute as to their ownership naturally arose.
The Church of England laid exclusive claim to the term “Protestant Clergy,” and, as a
consequence, to the Reserves. The other denominations opposed these pretensions. At
length, in 1840, an Imperial Act, intended to settle the question finally, decreed that the
proceeds of all sales of reserved lands to date should be divided between the churches of
England and Scotland,—the former body to receive two-thirds and the latter one-third;
and that all future proceeds from such sales should be handed over, in the proportion of
one-third and one-sixth, to the same churches; the residue to be devoted to the cause of
public worship and religious instruction generally—in other words, to be divided, as might
be, amongst such of the other Protestant denominations as cared to apply for it. This Act
quite failed to allay the sense of injustice in regard to the Reserves, and the matter continued
in agitation. In 1844 many supporters of the Reform party insisted on the question
being made a political issue, and called upon the Government to petition the Home authorities
for the repeal of the Act of 1840 as a preliminary to a radical settlement of the
difficulty by the complete secularization of the Reserves. The Government failed to
respond to this suggestion, and in 1849 a number of influential Reformers protested against
the delay by stepping out of the Government ranks and forming a new organization, which
became known by the <i>sobriquet</i> of the “Clear Grit” party. About the same time a
somewhat similar departure was made by a number of French Liberals, who formed <i>Le
Parti Rouge</i> under the leadership of Mr. Papineau. These new organizations joined in
the advocacy of several advanced measures of reform, though the <i>Rouges</i> were on many
points far more radical than the “Grits.” When the session of 1850 opened, the Government
found themselves confronted by an opposition not to be despised either in numbers or
influence, aside from Conservatives, led by Sir Allan MacNab, John A. Macdonald, Wm.
Cayley and Henry Sherwood. An incident of the session (to which reference is made in
the caricature from <i>Punch in Canada</i> annexed) was the defection from the Conservative
ranks of Col. Gugy, who had long been known as an ultra Tory. The reason assigned
for this step by the hon. gentleman was his disapproval of the extreme rancor displayed
during the opening debate by Sir Allan MacNab towards his political opponents, on issues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>which were practically dead, and to aspersions cast by that gentleman upon the Governor-General
in connection with the events of 1837-8. The Clear Grits vigorously attacked the
Government for their procrastination in the matter of the Clergy Reserves, and advocated
the immediate passage of a Bill, without waiting for the formality of the repeal of the
Imperial Act. It was evident that the Cabinet were by no means of one mind on this
important question, and these passionate appeals were unheeded. The pressure was great
enough, however, to ensure the passage of a resolution in favor of the repeal of the Act,
and in due course an Address in accordance therewith was forwarded to the Imperial
authorities. The attitude of the Ministry, however, was not definite enough to meet the
views of the Reform Party at large,
and the consequence was many defections
from the ranks. Amongst warm
friends who had been transformed
to lukewarmness, was Mr. George
Brown. The <i>Globe</i>, which had ridiculed
the “Clear Grit” movement
from its inception, was now preparing
to cast in its fortunes with that
faction. The next year was notable
for the re-entry into Parliament of
William Lyon Mackenzie, the hero
of the Rebellion of ’38. He was
elected as member for Haldimand,
having defeated Mr. Brown, who as yet professed a certain amount of friendship for
the Government. Mackenzie, of course, entered the House as their pronounced opponent,
and soon became the clearest of Clear Grits. During the session of this year (1851) an
Act was introduced by Hon. Mr. Hincks to make provision for the construction of a trunk
line of railway from Quebec to the west. A guaranteed loan from the Home Government—such
as had already been promised to Nova Scotia in promotion of a line from Halifax to
Quebec, was anticipated. The outcome of this Act, some years later, was the Grand
Trunk railway. Before the close of the session the <i>Globe</i> had reached the point of open
hostility to the Government, and clamored for immediate action on the Clergy Reserves
question. As yet, however, Mr. Brown was not in actual alliance with the Clear Grits.
One of the planks in the platform of that party was the abolition of the Court of Chancery,
which, as has been mentioned, was re-organized and established under Mr. Baldwin’s
auspices in 1849. Toward the end of the session, Mr. Lyon Mackenzie introduced a resolution
looking to the abolition of this Court, and although defeated on a division, the fact
that a majority of the Upper Canada members had voted in favor of the motion affected
Mr. Baldwin so keenly that he resigned his office and retired from the Cabinet. Before
the end of the same year Mr. Lafontaine also resigned, in pursuance of his expressed
intention of retiring from public life. This act was immediately followed by the resignation
of the remaining ministers, and the Lafontaine-Baldwin Cabinet thus passed calmly out of
existence. Mr. Lafontaine was raised to the Bench as Chief Justice of Quebec in 1853,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>and the next year was created a Baronet. He died at Montreal, Feb. 26, 1864. Mr.
Baldwin was defeated in North York at the ensuing general election by Mr. Joseph
Hartman, a Clear Grit candidate, and this respected leader then permanently retired from
public life. In 1854 he was made a C. B. The late Ministry having practically fallen
before the Reform spirit of the day, the demand was for a Cabinet still less conservative.
The formation of such a Cabinet was entrusted to Mr. (now Sir Francis) Hincks, who had
been a prominent member of the late Administration, and was regarded as one of the most
capable public men of the time. In a few months Mr. Hincks had completed the task
committed to him by making judicious concessions to the Clear Grit sentiment and to all
other forces which were capable of retarding the course of legislation. Mr. Morin, being
the acknowledged leader of the French Liberals since the retirement of Mr. Lafontaine,
headed the Lower Canada branch of the Government, which is known in our history as the
Hincks-Morin Administration. The <i>Globe</i> came out strongly against the new Premier,
expressing a total want of confidence in the sincerity of his Reform professions, and
charging him with surrendering to French Canadian influence. The cause of the Government
was on the other hand ably advocated by the Toronto <i>North American</i> (edited by
Mr. Wm. Macdougall) and the Montreal <i>Pilot</i>, a journal established some years previously
by Mr. Hincks himself. During the general election (1851) Mr. Brown was returned as
member for Kent, and at once became a conspicuous figure in the House at Quebec—whither,
in accordance with the alternating system, the seat of Government had been
removed. Early in the new year Mr. Hincks proceeded to England, in company with Mr.
E. B. Chandler of New Brunswick, to arrange for the Imperial guarantee to the construction
of the Intercolonial railway, which, it had been agreed, should be built by the three Provinces
of Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, to connect Halifax and Quebec by way of
the St. John Valley. The Home authorities expressed a preference for a military route
around the shore, and declined the guarantee on any other condition. Though unsuccessful
in this matter, Mr. Hincks succeeded, during his stay in England, in arranging for the
formation of what is now known as the Grand Trunk railway company, to secure the early
construction of the line westward from Montreal. On the Premier’s return to Canada in
1852, the session opened, and Mr. Brown took the earliest opportunity of expressing his
opinion that the Government was Reform in name only. Mr. John A. Macdonald also
attacked them sharply, alleging that there was no principle in common among members of
the Administration except the desire to hold office. During the session Mr. Hincks introduced
a series of resolutions strongly urging the repeal of the Clergy Reserves Act of 1840,
and an Address founded upon them was forwarded to the Queen. In October of this year
Mr. Narcisse Fortunat Belleau (the subject of one of our cartoons) received a seat in the
Legislative Council. Parliament adjourned on account of the presence of cholera at Quebec,
between Nov. 10, 1852, and Feb. 14th, 1853. During this recess a despatch from the
Home Secretary announced the intention of the Imperial Government to repeal the Act of
1840, and to pass an Act authorizing the Canadian Parliament to deal with the Clergy
Reserves question. On the re-assembling of the House a Representation Act was passed,
increasing the membership from 84 to 130—65 for each section of the Province. About
the same time it became known in Canada that the promised legislation in the matter of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>the Clergy Reserves had been passed in England, and the ardent advocates of secularization
renewed their agitation for immediate action by the Provincial Government. The session
was allowed to end, however, without any intimation of the Government’s intentions, and
this apparent want of good faith, in connection with various charges of extravagance in
connection with railway contracts, and other shortcomings, furnished an abundance of
ammunition for the Opposition in the interim. The Ministry decided to take no action
on the Clergy Reserves question, the reason assigned being that it would be better to leave
such important legislation to the next Parliament, in which there would be a larger representation
of the people. This resolve, when announced in Parliament, raised a furious
storm amongst the extreme members of the Opposition. No fewer than four amendments
were moved to the Address in Reply, and the defeat of the Government was practically
accomplished on a vote regretting that a measure for the settlement of the Seigniorial
Tenure and Reserves question was not to be submitted during the session. This motion
was carried by forty-two against twenty-nine. Mr. Hincks asked for an adjournment for
a day or two, which was granted. The Ministry decided to dissolve the House, and when
the members re-assembled, Black Rod forthwith knocked at the door. The general
election came off in the following July and August. Amongst the members of the
new House subsequently noticed in our cartoons were Messrs. Luther Hamilton Holton
and A. A. Dorion. The Assembly was now divided into three distinct parties: Ministerialists;
Conservatives, led nominally by Sir A. MacNab,—really by Mr. John A.
Macdonald; and Advanced Reformers, including Clear Grits and <i>Rouges</i>. Mr. Brown
was now, to all intents and purposes, not only an ally but a leader of the last named
party, with Mr. Dorion for his Lower Canada colleague. The Ministry managed to
weather the storm for but a few days after the opening of the session; they were then
defeated by a vote on a question of privilege raised by the Opposition, and handed in their
resignations. This was on Sept. 8th, 1854. Sir Allan MacNab was called upon to form
an Administration, a task which was only possible of accomplishment by the sacrifice on his
part of cherished convictions at the bidding of expediency. The Government to be
formed had before it the work of secularizing the Reserves, and to this Sir Allan, in
common with the old Conservatives whom he represented, was opposed. Rather, however,
than yield the leadership to the hands of his rising colleague, Macdonald, Sir Allan
accepted the responsibility, and in due time completed the formation of a Government by
an alliance of Conservatives and moderate French Liberals, with two representatives of
the ministerial party nominated by Mr. Hincks. This Government, taking the names of
the leaders of the two sections as was customary, is known as the MacNab-Morin
Administration. The immediate secularization of the Reserves was an essential condition
of the coalition, and the passage of a Bill abolishing the Seigniorial Tenure had also been
stipulated for. With the advent of the new Cabinet, the old Tory Party may be said to
have become extinct, as the leading colleagues of the new Premier were imbued with the
prevailing spirit of progress to an extent which would almost entitle them to the name of
Liberals. That title was, indeed, adopted, and the party in question has ever since been
known as Liberal-Conservative. The old time Reform Party became similarly modified,
by the absorption of its more conservative element into the ranks of Government supporters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>and of its radical members into the Clear Grit or <i>Rouge</i> party. The pledges of the Government
as to the Reserves question were duly fulfilled by the introduction of the Secularization
Act by Mr. John A. Macdonald in 1854. During the same session, the Seignioral Tenure
system, a long-standing grievance of Lower Canada—a remnant of mediævalism, under
which the tillers of the soil were practically the vassals of feudal lords—was also abolished.
Upon the prorogation of Parliament Lord Elgin retired from the Governor-Generalship,
and was succeeded by Sir Edmund Head. By a reconstruction of the Lower Canada
section of the Cabinet during the recess, Mr. Geo. E. Cartier became Provincial Secretary.
This is noteworthy, as marking the commencement of the long-continued comradeship in
office of that gentleman with Mr. J. A. Macdonald. After another brief session at Quebec,
the seat of Government was removed to Toronto. Meantime (in 1855) Mr. Hincks, while
absent in England, received the appointment of Governor of Barbadoes and the Windward
Islands and his connection with Canadian affairs thus ended for the time being. The questions
of Separate Schools for Roman Catholics, and Representation by Population, were the
important topics of political discussion next to be brought forward, but before they had
become ripe for legislative action, an important change had taken place in the Ministry.
The colleagues and supporters of the Government had become impatient of the nerveless
leadership of Sir Allan MacNab, and anxious to replace him by an abler man, who
stood ready for the position in the person of Mr. John A. Macdonald. Sir Allan MacNab,
however, would not voluntarily resign, and the affairs of the Government were thus kept
in a awkward state of suspense for a considerable time. The “conspirators” in the
Cabinet at last succeeded in carrying their point. A resolution of confidence having
been moved on the question of making Quebec the permanent seat of Government, the
vote was taken, and it was found that although duly carried, a majority of the Upper
Canada members had voted against it. This was seized upon as a pretext and, on a
profession of adherence to the principle of a “double majority” (a principle which had
never been adopted by either party), the Ministers handed in their resignations. This left
Sir Allan alone in his glory, and he being unable to fill the vacant places. Col. Taché, as
the senior Executive Councillor, was entrusted with the task of forming a ministry, which
he speedily accomplished by replacing the members of the late Cabinet. Mr. Macdonald
was made Attorney-General West, and was the actual leader (May, 1856). On a motion
of no confidence moved by Mr. Dorion, the reconstructed ministry found the adverse
Upper Canada majority increased, but having got rid of old Sir Allan they were not now
so particular about the double majority “principle” and entertained no thought of resigning.
For some time prior to 1856 Mr. Wm. Macdougall, as editor of the <i>North
American</i>, had been agitating the question of the Hudson’s Bay Company’s possessions in
the North-West. The project of obtaining control of that valuable domain for Canada
now began to take shape, and was warmly advocated by many of the leading public men.
Communications on the subject were opened with the Company, and early in 1857, Chief Justice
Draper was sent over to England to represent the Province in the negotiations. During
the Parliamentary session of the same year Mr. George Brown introduced a resolution in
favor of the principle of Representation by Population, which, although defeated, received
strong support in the House and throughout the country. The vexed question of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>permanent seat of Government was avoided by the submission of the matter to Her
Majesty, who, in due course, named Ottawa, as a compromise between the conflicting claims
of Toronto and Quebec. By the retirement of Col. Taché, which took place this year, Mr.
Macdonald became Premier, and Mr. Cartier was formally appointed leader of the Lower
Canada section of the Government. Parliament was dissolved in November and the
general election came off in December and January. It was during this campaign that
Mr. George Brown contested Toronto against Mr. John Beverley Robinson and others—reference
to which is made in cartoons 17 to 24. Amongst the new members elected
were Messrs. T. D’Arcy McGee, Hector L. Langevin, Christopher Duncan, Oliver Mowat,
Wm. P. Howland, and John Carling. The main questions upon which the elections
turned were Separate Schools and Representation by Population, and the general result was
a weakening of the Upper Canada support of the Government and a more than proportionate
addition to their Lower Canada following. When the House met in 1858, the
“double majority” doctrine was promptly cast overboard, as it was clear the Ministry had
to rely wholly on a Lower Canada majority. A motion expressing dissatisfaction with the
selection of Ottawa as seat of Government, which appealed alike to the French and English
members of the House, was carried by sixty-four to fifty. Thereupon the Government
resigned, and Mr. George Brown was called upon, as leader of the Opposition, to form an
Administration. This he succeeded in doing. He asked, however, for a dissolution of the
House and an appeal to the country, on the ground that the present Assembly did not
fairly represent public opinion. The Governor-General, upon consideration, declined to
accede to this, and a vote of no confidence having been carried in the House, Mr. Brown
and his colleagues handed in their resignations. The lately deposed ministers were recalled,
and, taking advantage of the letter of the law which permitted of an interchange
of portfolios without an appeal to the country, Mr. Macdonald and his colleagues performed
what is notorious in our annals as the “Double Shuffle.” The members of the Government
resumed the treasury benches upon making a mere re-distribution of the offices. Having
been duly sworn in, they then made another re-distribution which left them in the positions
which they originally occupied.</p>

<p class='c010'>The rejection of the double majority principle, and the popular demand for representation
by population had given rise to the idea of a Federal Union of the Provinces of British
North America, and the “new” Government announced that the feasibility of this scheme
would receive the most serious consideration. Mr. A. T. Galt, who was now Inspector-General,
was known as a strong advocate of Confederation, and on entering the Ministry
he had insisted on it being made a Cabinet question. In the next session Ottawa was
formally accepted as the seat of Government by a motion in the House, which was carried
by a majority of five. A new Tariff Act, raising the general duties to fifteen per cent.,
was amongst the measures of the session, and marks the commencement of Protection in
Canada.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the close of the session the departments were once more established at Quebec,
whence in 1866 they were removed to Ottawa and permanently settled in the new Parliament
buildings. The Government was now sustained entirely by Lower Canada votes, and
the cry of French domination was being vociferously raised in the Upper Province. As the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>outcome of a Liberal convention an address to the people made its appearance in 1860.
This document, which forcibly exposed the unsatisfactory state into which public affairs had
been brought by the existing system, was widely distributed, and is regarded as having done
much to pave the way for the Confederation scheme subsequently matured. The Liberal
leaders of Lower Canada were disposed to admit the justice of the complaints thus formulated,
but no great expression of sympathy could be expected in that quarter for a cause with
which the name of George Brown was intimately associated. In the meantime, the divisions
in the ranks of the Opposition aided the Government. In the following session (1860) Mr.
Brown introduced two motions embodying the reforms discussed at the convention, and
suggesting, as a remedy for the evils complained of, the formation of local governments
for the management of Provincial affairs, with some central authority to take cognizance of
affairs common to all sections. These resolutions were defeated by overwhelming majorities.
In connection with changes in the <i>personnel</i> of the Parliamentary forces during 1860,
it may be noted that Sir Allan MacNab was elected to a seat in the Legislative Council, and
Mr. Chas. J. Rykert succeeded Mr. Merritt as member for Lincoln in the Assembly. The
agitation for “Rep. by Pop.” and its proposed accompanying reforms was not allowed to die
out. Mr. D’Arcy McGee continued to eloquently advocate the Federal Union plan, and the
<i>Globe</i> kept steadily educating public opinion upon the subject. In the next session resolutions
in favor of the “double majority” principle, moved respectively by Mr. J. Sandfield
Macdonald and Mr. A. A. Dorion, obtained a fair measure of support in the House, being
defeated by majorities of only thirteen and nineteen. Amongst the supporters of these
motions were several prominent French Canadians who had hitherto acted with the Government,
and ere long an alliance between these gentlemen and the Upper Canada
followers of Mr. J. S. Macdonald was brought about, much to the embarrassment of the
Ministry. The publication of the returns of the census, which had just been completed,
gave new life to the agitation for Rep. by Pop. as they showed that the population of the
Upper Province was 300,000 in excess of that of Lower Canada. A measure embodying
to some extent the principles contended for was, however, defeated by a vote of sixty-seven
to forty-nine. On the 10th of June Parliament was dissolved, and at the ensuing general
election the Government was sustained, notwithstanding the herculean efforts of the
Opposition. Mr. Brown himself was defeated in East Toronto, and Mr. Dorion failed in
Lower Canada. Mr. Brown remained out of Parliament until 1863; Mr. Dorion was
returned for Hochelaga in the year following his defeat. Amongst the new members
(subsequently noticed in our cartoons) were Alexander Mackenzie and H. G. Joly. Mr.
Mackenzie was elected for Lambton, and has remained in Parliament to the present time.
M. Joly sat as member for Lotbinière. Mr. Wm. Lyon Mackenzie, who had resigned his
seat for Haldimand in 1858, died during the summer of this year.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sir Edmund Head’s term having expired, he was succeeded in the Governorship by
Viscount Monck. In 1862 Mr. John Beverley Robinson and Mr. John Carling became
members of the Cabinet, the former as President of the Council, and the latter as Receiver-General.
Both of these gentlemen (who figure in several of our cartoons) were favorable
to Rep. by Pop., and that question was henceforth to be regarded as “open” in the Cabinet.
The Ministerial span of life was, however, now at an end. Before the session closed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>the Government sustained a decisive defeat on a militia bill introduced by Attorney-General
Macdonald, and resigned on the following day. The Macdonald-Sicotte Administration
succeeded to the vacant benches, the Premier being Mr. John Sandfield Macdonald, and
his Lower Canadian colleague, Mr. L. V. Sicotte, a former follower of Mr. Cartier.
The new Ministry, in announcing their programme, practically ignored the question
of Rep. by Pop., and adopted the principle of Separate Schools. In the following
session Mr. George Brown (who had meantime been elected for South Oxford) found
himself at the head of a strong party in opposition to the Government on the issues named,
and although the “double majority” principle was supposed to have been adopted by the
Ministry, they resisted defeat on many divisions by a solid Lower Canada vote. Indeed,
in this respect they were in precisely the same position as the Government they had
replaced. This disingenuous conduct brought swift punishment. The Government was in
May defeated on a direct vote of want of confidence, and a dissolution was decided upon.
The general election was fixed for June, and resulted in the Government being sustained.
The <i>personnel</i> of the Cabinet had undergone some changes in the meantime. Mr. Oliver
Mowat being taken in as Postmaster-General, and the Lower Canada section being as
follows: A. A. Dorion, L. H. Holton, Isidore Thibaudeau, L. Letellier de St. Just, L. S.
Huntington and Maurice Laframboise. Mr. Huntington was comparatively new to Parliament,
and represented Shefford. In the second session after its formation this Government
voluntarily resigned office, being unable to command a working majority, and in the
meantime little if any progress had been made toward the settlement of the great question
of the day. After some difficulty a new Government was formed under the joint leadership
of Sir E. P. Taché and Hon. John A. Macdonald. In this Cabinet Mr. Hector
L. Langevin first sat as a Minister; the new names in the Upper Canada section
were those of Messrs. John Simpson and James Cockburn. It was found, on the reassembly
of Parliament, that this Government, like its predecessor, could not command a
working majority, and it was evident that no Ministry it would be possible to form from
the material available would be in any better position. It had been decided to dissolve the
House and appeal to the country, when, at the critical moment, Mr. George Brown
suggested that the crisis might be utilized to settle the constitutional difficulties between
Upper and Lower Canada on the line of the recommendations just laid before the House
by a committee entrusted with the consideration of that subject, viz.: a Confederation of
the Provinces.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>As the result of conferences then initiated a Federal Union of the Provinces was
decided upon, and three Reformers, Messrs. Brown, Mowat and Macdougall entered the
Government to assist in carrying the plan into effect. In due course the Imperial authorities
passed the necessary legislation, under the title of the British North America Act,
and on the 1st of July, 1867, the plan was consummated, and the Dominion of Canada came
into existence. For distinguished services in connection with this great measure, Mr.
Macdonald was honored with knighthood, and in the following year Mr. Cartier accepted
a baronetcy. Other distinguished Confederationists received minor honors. In the
ensuing general election, Mr. Brown was defeated in South Ontario, and never thereafter
sat in Parliament. In 1873 he accepted a seat in the Senate at the hands of the Reform
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Government of Mr. Mackenzie, and in that quiet retreat ended his eventful political career.
The formation of Provincial Ministries had meantime been arranged for. In Ontario, the
first Cabinet—a coalition—was under the leadership of Mr. John Sandfield Macdonald,
and remained in office for the ensuing four years. Amongst the new Members of the first
Dominion Parliament were Joseph Howe of Nova Scotia and Edward Blake of Ontario,
the latter gentleman being at the same election (1867)
returned as a member of the Ontario Assembly, where he
soon assumed the leadership of the Opposition. Mr. Howe
continued his active efforts against Confederation both in
and out of the House. In 1868 he was the leading member
of a delegation to England to present an address in favor of
the repeal of the Union on behalf of Nova Scotia. This
petition was rejected, and early in 1869 Mr. Howe was
induced to enter the Cabinet, certain modifications of the
terms of Union being promised. In 1868, Lord Monck was
succeeded in the Governorship by Sir John Young (afterward
Lord Lisgar). In the ensuing session, the North-West
Territories, which had been acquired by the extinction of
the Hudson’s Bay Company’s claim, were formally added to
the Dominion, and an Act was passed to provide for the
appointment of a Lieutenant-Governor and Council to administer
their affairs. The closing negotiations in England
had been conducted by Sir Geo. Cartier (Cartoon 32) and
Hon. Wm. Macdougall, and in recognition of his services
the latter gentleman was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of
the new Territory. The Metis settlers, however, felt
aggrieved that the transfer had been effected without their
consent, and entertained a want of confidence in the good-will
of the new owners of the country. The result was that
when Lieutenant-Governor Macdougall undertook to assume
the direction of affairs he was met by armed resistance,
and found that the half-breeds about Fort Garry were in open rebellion under the
leadership of one Louis Riel. Upon the peremptory order of the rebels Mr. Macdougall
was forced to retreat from the frontier (Cartoon 49). Meanwhile the rebellion went on.
Bishop Taché, a prelate of vast influence amongst the half-breeds, happened unfortunately
to be absent in Rome. It being clear that peace could not be restored without his
intervention, he was communicated with, and on his arrival at Ottawa he was empowered
to offer the rebels an amnesty for all past offences and to assure them of the good-will of
the Dominion. He at once departed on his mission, but before his arrival at the Red
River, Riel had crowned his folly and wickedness by the cold-blooded murder of a loyalist
named Thomas Scott, under form of a “court martial” execution. The Bishop, notwithstanding
this, duly delivered his message. The rebels were ultimately overawed by the
appearance of a military force under command of Colonel (afterwards Sir Garnet) Wolseley,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>and Riel took flight. He returned, however, after a time, and remained in Manitoba unmolested
until the offer of a reward for his apprehension by the Ontario Government caused
him to seek safety on the American side. To forestall further trouble the Dominion Government,
at the suggestion of Bishop Taché, secretly provided him with some $1,500 on
condition of his remaining out of the country for good. With this strangely acquired
booty he took up his residence in the United States. He was subsequently twice elected
to Parliament for the constituency of Provencher, Manitoba, but his banishment from the
country for five years was decreed in connection with the general amnesty subsequently
ratified by the Mackenzie Government.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1872 Sir John Macdonald was appointed one of the British Commissioners for the
arrangement of a treaty involving the fishery interests of Canada, amongst other important
matters, as between Great Britain and the United States. The result of the Commissioners’
labors is known as the Washington Treaty, which was ratified in that year. By this
document, <i>inter alia</i>, the right to take fish in Canadian waters was extended to the United
States for the period of ten years in consideration of a money payment, the amount subsequently
agreed upon by a joint Commission, which met at Halifax in 1877, being
$5,500,000. This the Americans paid, but only after a protest on flimsy grounds by their
representative, Mr. Kellogg, and much grumbling by Congress. In 1871, British Columbia
was admitted to the Union. In the session of the following year a Bill was passed empowering
the Government to contract with a chartered company for the construction of a railway
to connect British Columbia with the Eastern Provinces. This year was also
signalized by the advent of Lord Dufferin as the successor of Baron Lisgar in the vice-regal
office, and by a general election, the term of the first Parliament of the Dominion
having expired. The result of the election was favorable to the Government, though the
Opposition was materially strengthened. In 1873 Confederation was rounded off by the
admission of Prince Edward Island into the Union. The session of this year is memorable
for the “Pacific Scandal.” Mr. Huntington from his place in the House charged the
Government with having corruptly sold the contract for the construction of the C. P. R.,
to Sir Hugh Allan, in consideration of a large contribution by that worthy knight to the
Conservative election fund. This unparalleled indictment caused a great sensation, and
eventually compelled the resignation of the Ministry. A Reform Government under Mr.
Mackenzie succeeded to office, and continued down to 1878, when the prevailing depression
of trade compassed its defeat, the Conservatives having declared for Protection to
native industries as a “National Policy,” a cry which caught the public fancy wonderfully.
The leading political incidents of the term thus briefly indicated are commented upon in
their order in the cartoons from <span class='sc'>Grip</span> presented in this volume. Early in 1880, Mr. Mackenzie
was succeeded in the leadership by Mr. Blake, who still remains at the head of the
Reform Party.</p>

<p class='c023'>This was the first of a series of cartoons which appeared in Toronto, in
1858, in connection with the election contest between Mr. John Beverley
Robinson and Mr. George Brown, for the representation of the city of
Toronto in Parliament. Mr. Bowes was Mayor for several years. He
was Mr. Robinson’s “right hand man” in the campaign, though, with a not
over-friendly hand the artist represents the candidate as occupying a
secondary position throughout. This was the occasion of Mr. Robinson’s first
entry into parliamentary life. This, and the five following cartoons are
inserted as an illustration of the manner in which public questions were
caricatured in those days.</p>

unlikely that the charge of wholesale, open bribery, here made against the

fortunate as to have a caricaturist on their side, or no doubt an equally
faithful picture might have been levelled at Mr. Brown and his supporters.</p>

the opponents of the measure in question, and was suspected of a preference
for annexation to the United States. In the cartoon the Province is represented
as halting between the two opinions, and the loyal artist takes pains
to point out that the advantages are all in the way that leads “to Ottawa.”</p>

this, and before any decided enquiry had been made into the matter, Parliament

Simcoe, in the Ontario Legislature, took place about this time. Although

member of the Ontario Cabinet. The story—which was regarded from the
first as a joke—was to the effect that Mr. McKellar had purchased for his
official apartment a portrait of an unknown lady. This imputation of gallantry
to the bucolic Minister—a man in all respects the reverse of the
ideal knight—was what constituted the “point.” The alleged picture soon
took its place in the armory of the Opposition and was constantly referred to
as that of “Little Mrs. Blank.” In the Public Accounts Committee about
the date of our cartoon, explanations were made by Messrs. Ewing &amp; Co.,
from whom certain pictures had been purchased, which completely killed this
pleasant fiction, and “Little Mrs. Blank” was no more. The leading
Members of the Opposition—Messrs. M. C. Cameron, A. Boultbee, C. J.
Rykert and A. W. Lauder—were supposed by the artist to have been much
cast-down at the sudden demise of such a valuable auxiliary.</p>

<p class='c023'>The amended election law (introduced by the government of Mr. Mackenzie)
was purposely made very stringent as a measure against bribery and corruption,
and at this time trials were first conducted under its provisions. It so
happened that the first victims were members of the party that had passed
the measure, but the slaughter was by no means confined to that party. The
expression “Come along, John, and put down bribery and corruption” had
been imputed to a supporter of one of the unseated members, in the course
of the election trial of Col. Walker, the member elect, at London, and for a
considerable time the phrase was one of the catch-words of the Conservative
Party.</p>

the existence of a Reform Party that could find nothing to reform. As Mr.

Mr. Smith was the recipient of a good deal of violent abuse in reply to his
attacks on Partyism, and being naturally a man of uncommon sensitiveness,
and very impatient of criticism, his lot was indeed “not a happy one.”</p>

that he defended himself against his critics with passionate brilliancy. The
sentence he is represented as speaking in the cartoon occurred in one of
his retorts upon the <i>Globe</i>, and was considered unusually cutting as an
exposition of that journal’s strict religious orthodoxy in contrast with its
merciless treatment of its opponents.</p>

<p class='c023'>Mr. George Brown was an earnest advocate of the Free Trade principle
in political economy, and was always vigorous in his denunciation of
the opposite principle in any direction. About this time the
<i>Globe</i> had earnestly denounced the action of the Ontario Society
of Physicians and Surgeons for having prosecuted an unlicensed
practitioner, under a law which the <i>Globe</i> always regarded as
narrow and tyrannical. This was not very consistent with the attitude
it sustained towards Mr. Goldwin Smith as a healer of the body
politic. Mr. Alderman Baxter, well-known in Toronto, is used as a
metaphorical figure of Justice.</p>

contributed for other than legitimate expenses, or that his letter had been

a speculation at the expense of the inmates of the Beauport Asylum at
Quebec—was characterized by Mr. Brown as an offence that was “rank and

press during M. Cauchon’s connection with the Ministry.</p>

enduring abject penury, was “in his mind” revelling in luxury. Being
obliged by cruel fortune to restrict his diet to cold water and raw turnips, he
rose equal to the occasion and gave it out that these staples were his special
choice as table delicacies. Being unable to afford fuel for his stove, he used
a lighted candle therein, on the philosophical ground that it was not heat
but merely the <i>appearance</i> of heat that was required. This eccentric genius
found a political anti-type in Sir John, who was now bravely making the best
of his reversed circumstances.</p>

Toronto by a party demonstration, embracing torch-lights and all the usual
accompanyments of such occasions. As the Northern Railway revelations
were at the moment occupying public attention, the procession was pictured
as it should have been rather than as it was. Mr. John Beverley Robinson,
M.P. for West Toronto, had shortly before this distinguished himself in a
personal encounter with the proprietor of the Toronto <i>Telegram</i>. Sir John
had, in a speech before the Session, declared that he and Robinson intended

been started in the newspapers. The injustice of exempting various officials

on the part of the Conservative leader was now manifest, for it is doubtful if
anything excepting this adroit appeal to the people’s pockets could possibly
have restored the Conservatives to power at this time.</p>

National Policy, was Mr. R. W. Phipps, a well-known journalist and
pamphleteer of Toronto. Sir John had during the campaign publicly
accorded high praise to this gentleman for his writings in support of Protection;
and indeed so great was the indebtedness expressed that Mr. Phipps
came to believe that he would certainly be offered the portfolio of Finance in
the New Government. Mr. Phipps, on the other hand, made no secret of his
own conviction that neither Sir John nor any of his colleagues really understood
the principles of political economy.</p>

portfolio, and still further in the absence from the list of Ministers of the
name of any person known to be a sincere Protectionist. It was alleged
that Hon. William Macdougall had also entertained hopes of a seat in the
Cabinet. The Manufacturers’ Association began to exhibit great activity in
view of the forthcoming Tariff changes.</p>

prosperity did not immediately return. The persistency with which the
depression continued to “hang on” was a source of much annoyance to the

<p class='c023'>Curiosity was on tiptoe throughout the country during the interim between
the election and the introduction of the National Policy. The Reform press
aggravated the popular impatience by constant—and not very reasonable—protests
against the delay. Indeed, some of the precipitous journalists

a new fiscal policy at all.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
